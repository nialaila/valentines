        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted this to be super poetic since this is your first Valentine‚Äôs Day love letter (if it‚Äôs not, pretend it is üòÇ), but I‚Äôm just gonna blabber my feelings out to you here, so it won‚Äôt be very poetic. Our first date was on Saturday, September 28th. On the walk from Oxford to Totoro, it started raining, and I was scared that you were gonna think I looked stupid with water droplets all over my glasses. I remember what you wore. I remember that we talked about how we were procrastinating our homework while we were waiting to be seated. I remember how nervous you were at the beginning, and how much your energy changed when we were walking back to Oxford. It made me happy that you were more comfortable with me. I remember how I felt when you texted me after. I remember our second date, especially since that‚Äôs the day I knew I fell for you. One of us had said something funny and we were laughing, but holding eye contact with each other. I fell for you at that moment because I swear I could feel our connection, and that was the first time I felt my heart glow for you. I remember our third date. I really loved the time we spent yapping outside Oxford and the best moment was when we were looking for a shooting star, and some guy yelled out ‚ÄúOmg a shooting star.‚Äù In my head, that was our sign. The sign that we would happen. I remember when you asked me to be your girlfriend (November 16th). I thought that I would want some big gesture because of, like, social influence, I guess. But I realized that I only needed words from the person who makes me soooooo happy that I can barely even comprehend the emotion. I know that I am not perfect, ben, but I am so happy that you chose me to be yours, and I hope that you continue to choose me because I will continue to choose you. I know you were surprised to hear that I wouldn‚Äôt choose 20 million dollars over you (from that reel lesly sent me that one night), but (and this is coming from someone who desperately needs a lump sum of money to come into her life) no amount of money will ever make me feel as happy as you do, honestly. And I hope that piece of information wasn't too much to hear this early into our relationship. I hope you don‚Äôt feel all of this is too soon, actually.  Anyways, I guess what I a trying to express is how glad I am that you have come into my life. I know I have said this before, but I really have never liked anyone the way I like you. I hope you can feel how much I like you and that you never have doubts about my feelings for you. You are such an amazing person, like really, and I am grateful to have the privilege to know you (and I can't wait to learn more and more about you). I appreciate the way you treat me so much; you make me feel cared for and I always feel so safe, like physically and emotionally, when I am with you. I don't know you just make me so happy, and I hope I make you happy, and I hope I am a good girlfriend to you. No one makes me laugh the way you do, no one makes me smile the way you do, and no one makes me feel the way you do. I am glad you are mine and that I am yours, and I hope this is the first of many Valentine's we celebrate together.
