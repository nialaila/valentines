        <p>Dear Benjamin, <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say how glad I am that you have come into my life. I know I have said this before, but I really have never liked anyone the way I like you. I hope you can feel how much I like you and that you never have doubts in my feelings for you. You are such an amazing person, like really, and I am grateful to have the privilege to know you (and I can't wait to learn more and more about you). I appreciate the way you treat me so much; you make me feel cared for and I always feel so safe, like physically and emotionally, when I am with you. I don't know, you just make me so happy, and I hope I make you happy, and I hope I am a good girlfriend to you. Also, I realized that you have already told me the exact moment you fell for me and I have yet to tell you when I fell for you. It was our second date at Culantro and one of us said something funny and we were laughing, but holding eye contact with each other, and in that moment I fell for you completely; I like felt our connection. No one makes me laugh the way you do, no one makes me smile the way you do, and no one makes me feel the way you do. I am glad you are mine and that I am yours, and I hope this is the first of many Valentine's we celebrate together. Anyways, I really hope you liked this. I got the idea from TikTok lol and thought it would be cool to do since I actually know some HTML and CSS now. <br><br> p.s. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1dvrcqlQgI">this song</a> makes me think of you <3</p>
